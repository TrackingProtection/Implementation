                The tracking status representation can have the following additional properties, as illustrated by the following

            <h4>controllerDescription</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><dfn>controllerDescription</dfn></code> containing an array of objects representing one or more Data Controllers jointly responsible for an origin.
                Each object contains a string <code><dfn>name</dfn></code> indicating the unique name of the Data Controller entity along with a string <code><dfn>url</dfn></code> containing the URI of a human readable web page describing the entity.
                If the <dfn>controller</dfn> TSR property is present the <code><dfn>url</dfn></code> property need not be. If the <code><dfn>url</dfn></code> property is present it overrides the value of any TSR <dfn>controller</dfn> property.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='rep.otherParties'>
            <h4>otherParties</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><dfn>otherParties</dfn></code> containing an array of objects representing embedded or contracted third-parties.
                Each object contains a string <code><dfn>domain</dfn></code> indicating the URI authority name of an embedded or contracted third-party <dfn>target</dfn> along with a status value of either "P" or "N".
                If a party can receive personal data and has contracted with the origin server as a Data Processor the status will be "P".
                If the party is known not to receive personal data from the interaction the status will be "N".
                This information can be used by browsers, browser extensions or script libraries to help protect user privacy by blocking or inhibiting the actions
                of resources that are not declared by the embedding site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The origin server for each declared domain with a status of "P" must support a Tracking Status Resource
                also containing an <code><dfn>otherParties</dfn></code> property,
                with a reference back to the declaring origin server's authority.
                This enables the user agent to confirm that the contracting parties are mutually aware.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='rep.declaredData'>
            <h4>declaredData</h4>
            <p>
                This is an object representing user agent storage employed by the origin server for tracking or other purposes.
                This gives the origin server the ability to transparently describe in a standardised way the overall retention time for client storage
                and the purpose and retention period for each storage item. User agents MAY present this information
                to the user, and privacy regulators, audit services etc. will be able use website scanning tools to verify it.
                In addition Privacy Enhancing Technology components, such as TrackingBlocker or AdBlocker extensions,
                can make intelligent decisions regarding content blocking or storage removal when enforcing a user's privacy preferences.
                The object contains a long integer <code><strong>overall_retention</strong></code> a positive number of seconds indicating the maximum lifetime of all the declared data.
                and an array of objects describing individual storage items controlled by the origin server.
                Each of these contains a <code><strong>selector</strong></code> string used to match the name or name-value pair of a particular item ,
                a string <code><strong>type</strong></code> representing the class of storage used where "C" is an HTTP cookie, "L" is local HTML5 storage and "I" is indexedDB.
                The <code><strong>selector</strong></code> string MAY contains a <code>=</code> character to demarcate between Regex match strings for the name and value of a name-value pair.
                The purposes for each item is encoded in the <code><strong>purpose</strong></code> array of objects.
                Each <code><strong>purpose</strong></code> object contains a short purpose identifier <code><strong>code</strong></code> and an option string <code><strong>description</strong></code> further describing the purpose.
                The <code><strong>code</strong></code> property MUST contain one or more of the following purpose identifiers.

                N.B. Maybe the Qualifiers property should have the same coding.
