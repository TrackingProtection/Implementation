            This is a proposal for an iteration to the [[tracking-dnt]] in DNT 1.0, based on server side implementation experience of  the Tracking, Compliance and Scope, and Tracking Protection Expression documents
            on consumer facing websites in Europe, and client side experience building a DNT compatible browser extension.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This is a proposal for changes to the Do Not Track Tracking Preference Expression document to fix problems uncovered implementing it on consumer facing website servers
            and implementing the full JavaScript DNT Exceptions API in a browser extension.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the 2009 amendment to the 2002 E-Privacy Directive,
            bringing it more fully in to line with the original intent of the 1995 Data Protection Directive and the fundamental human right to privacy,
            there existed a legal requirement for companies to extend control over online tracking to users (data subjects).
            This has created opportunities to implement many of the functions described in the TPE "toolbox", such as the Consent API and the Tracking Status Resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            In many ways compliance with European Data Protection law requires features that are a superset of those described in the Tracking, Compliance and Scope document.
            In Europe a a data controller, for instance a company that collects and/or processes personal data, can only do so if it has one of a small set of sanctioned legal bases,
            and someone's individual web activity is classed as personal data. There is also additional restriction on the access to data held within an individual's computer or browser described
            in the amended E-Privacy Directive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term "Tracking" has a restricted definition in the TPE, but has wider connotations in Europe, where data controllers can only track data subjects
            around the web when they have specific opt-in consent or can claim one of the other legal bases.
            If they can claim to have a "legitimate interest" in tracking people, they may not need a prior opt-in, but they still need to offer the user the ability
            to opt-out i.e. exercise their right to object.
            This right is defined more fully in the new General Data Protection Regulation which says the right may be exercised by "automated means using technical specifications" <cite>Article 21.5</cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the explicit Do Not Track (DNT:1) state must continue to be a clear expression of a user's objection to tracking,
            when consent is obtained there should be a more multi-layered way for a user to indicate what they agree to, and for the origin server's response to that
            to be more transparent and verifiable.
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant reason for the rising popularity of ad-blockers is individuals' awareness of invisible tracking and their lack of control over it.
            This could be seen as a win for privacy but ad-blockers not only threaten the online advertising business models but also damage the web platform through the arbitrary and uninformed blocking of
            content. Giving people maximum control over, and visibility of, tracking could reduce the need for arbitrary content blocking and also create an environment where
            socially responsible and privacy respecting companies would not be disadvantaged.
        </p>
        <p>
            In DNT 1.0 the "G" or Gateway response was added more or less as an afterthought as an attempt to address the challenges arising from real time bidding for advertising.
            The typical ad exchange often contracts with several, perhaps thousands, of parties who will bid to place on-line ads in a web page.
            Because the Same Origin Policy restricts the data that can be passed between parties there is no way within the current TPE protocol for an ad exchange to determine
            what the current DNT status of a contracting party is. Furthermore an ad exchange should be able to request consent from a user for a set of "downstream" parties
            while still giving users the ability to revoke their consent for any of them at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where consent has not been unambiguously given, servers should not use cookie or other identifiers, or derive them from browser's unique characteristics.
            When consent has been specifically given there should be a protocol to create a cross-domain identifier, but which is visible and continuously capable of being easily revoked by the user.
            If these restrictions are explained and potentially verifiable the user will be far more likely to give their specific permission for tracking. Such an identifier must be restricted in scope to the first-party, for example a publisher,
            and its set of contracted third-parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            This supplementary protocol attempts to address the following issues:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Site-specific consent indications to third-parties</h3>
                    An ad exchange or platform should be able to request site-specific tracking permission for a set of contracting parties who
                    have entered into contracts with the exchange and whose domains are either referenced by a browsing context (i.e. an iframe) controlled by the exchange,
                    or where data is passed between the parties using a server-server mechanism.
                    For transparency, the identity of the ad exchange and the ultimate parties MUST be available in a “machine readable” form.
                    An ad exchange with tracking permission should be able to receive an indication of the current tracking permissions
                    associated with a subset of its declared contracting parties. This must be done in a way that minimises the risk of "drive-by" fingerprinting.
                    It should be possible for a user at any time to revoke the permission for any party, not just all the parties in an initial set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Consent sub-categorisation</h3>
                    Permissions should be multi-layered, i.e. a red, yellow, and green status representing no tracking, "pseudonymous" or "controlled" tracking and "full" tracking.
                    The "pseudonymous tracking" state represent a mode which would enable audience categorisation while inhibiting the "singling-out" of individuals
                    for the purpose of profiling, helping data controllers meet their data protection obligations e.g. data minimisation, in a transparent, standardised way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Publisher ID</h3>
                    There should be support for a standardised site specific "publisher id" capability,
                    giving explicitly trusted advertisers a cross-origin online identifier to single-out the user-agent without the need for "cookie synching",
                    while giving more control to the user, i.e. in addition to the ability to revoke their consent,
                    by allowing them to reset the identifier at any time. To enable verifiable data-minimisation commitments the identifier should have a transparently
                    declared expiry time and entropy (bit length).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Right to access of tracking data</h3>
                    The current value of the publisher id can be used to derive an audience descriptor based on the data an origin server has linked to it. This descriptor
                    should be visible to the user by encoding it into a property in the Tracking Status Resource. The advertiser id will be available via the DNT:0 header
                    when the [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt#status-resource/">TSR</a>]is requested from the origin server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tracking Status Header via Meta Tag</h3>
                    It is often logistically difficult for servers to support additional response headers, especially if they are dynamic in nature. We propose
                    that the Tk: response header should be deployable via script in the top-level browsing context, using the <code>http-equiv</code> attribute of a dynamically created <code>meta</code> tag.
                    This will allow sites who otherwise comply with Do Not Track to indicate as such without needing to generate the response header, by including the relevant script.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>DNT header deliverable in well-known named cookie.</h3>
                    The new transparency features should be implementable, at least to some extent, by script libraries when the underlying protocol is not implemented by a particular user-agent.
                    Delivering the protocol elements, e.g. the user revocable id, may not be possible to insert in a DNT request header but would be possible as the value of an HTTP cookie
                    with a standardised name. We propose using the cookie name <code>$DNT</code> for this. This will allow the transparent communication of a user's general preference not to be tracked, as well as
                    the registration that consent has been given to a particular server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        New and enhanced API functionality.
                    </h3>
                    The new <code>confirmTrackingException</code> and enhanced <code>storeSiteSpecificTrackingException</code> MAY return a Promise with a fulfilment value of <code>TrackingStatusObject</code>.
                    This helps the API be more in line with the asynchronous nature of client side JavaScript, and creates callback functionality so web applications can respond dynamically in cases
                    where the user agent confirms Consent with the user before the Consent Grant is registered, and is conditional on confirmation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>useSameParty to replace cookie type subdomain rules</h3>
                    The use of the domain parameter wastes unnecessary cycles on checking for potential grants for subdomains. The API dictionary now includes a <code>useSameDomain</code>
                    property which, if set <code>true</code>, will signal the user agent that a particular Consent Grant should also apply to the domains referred to by the <dfn>same-party</dfn>
                    TSR array property. The user-agent MAY check that the targeted domains contain TSRs that refer back to the host domain of the calling origin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The current TPE document has the following bugs:
        <p>
            https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/drafts/tracking-dnt.html#dnt-header-field "A user agent must not generate a DNT header field if the user's tracking preference is not enabled.". Contradicts EU requirement for DNT:0 to override DNT unset.
        </p>
        <p>The restrictions on DNT Extensions are too onerous</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            G Tracking Status Value is non-nonsensical. Needs to be changed to take Permissions into account
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Extensions to the DNT Header field</h2>
        <p>
            The following extensions to the DNT header are proposed. There can be 0 or more extensions each separated by "&" following the DNT header field value.
            Extensions are determined by the user agent as a result of calls to the extended API described below.
            If the Do Not Track general preference has not been set and an extension has been specified a DNT header will be inserted without a DNT field value, see the example below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn">DNT-permission</dfn>. This is used to efficiently notify an origin server which of its declared contracting parties have permission to track,
                    i.e. can receive audience categorisation or unique user identifying data.
                    It is denoted by "p=" followed by a list of decimally encoded ranges of zero-based indexes into the list of domains specified in the TSV
                    <code>otherParties</code> property.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if the registered otherParties property for this origin server contained the array
                    <pre>["example.com","adco.com","other.com","andanother.com","yetanother.com"]</pre>
                    a request containing
                    <pre>DNT:0 p=0-2,4</pre>
                    would indicate that the origin server and those for <code>example.com, adco.com, other.com and yetanother.com</code> had been given permission,
                    but <code>addanother.com</code> had not (or it's permission had been revoked).
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn">DNT-identifier</dfn>. This is a user agent generated online identifier initiated by a call to the API
                    and denoted by <code>i=</code> followed by a hexadecimal encoded bit string. The user agent will ensure that bit length (entropy) and expiry time of the identifier is no greater
                    than that declared in the origin server's [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt#status-resource/">TSR</a>].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The value of the bit string should be calculated by obtaining a cryptographic quality random number as described in section 4.5 of [[RFC4122]] for the 47 bit
                    UUID node, but using the appropriate bit length as described in this specification. It is important that no information about the client is leaked
                    i.e. the identifier should not be derived from an IEEE MAC address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An identical identifier will be inserted into requests to consented-to embedded third-parties i.e.
                    origin servers referenced by the descendant browsing contexts of this origin server where the DNT field value is "0".
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example an HTTP request to an ad exchange containing
                    <pre>DNT:0 i=1f54acef29&p=0-2,4</pre>
                    would indicate consent to it and its contracting domains along with an identifier for this user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origin servers for the consented-to embedded third-parties would receive
                    <pre>DNT:0 i=1f54acef29</pre>
                    indicating the same online identifier but would not contain the <dfn>DNT-permission</dfn> extension.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn">DNT-revoked</dfn>. When included in a DNT:1 header this indicates that a previous DNT:0 consent indication has been revoked by the user agent.
                    Invoking either the <code>storeWebWideTrackingException</code> or <code>storeWebWideTrackingException</code> JavaScript functions in the origin server's browsing context
                    will result in the removal of this qualifier. The qualifier will also be removed after the original Tracking Consent would have expired.
                </p>
                <p>This qualifier can be used by an origin server to adjust its behaviour on receipt of DNT:1. For example it could decide not initiate another request for consent when the user has already revoked it.</p>
                <p>This qualifier has no meaning if it is in a DNT:0 header and in that case MUST be ignored.</p>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The extensions are defined formally by the following ABNF
            <pre class="abnf">
            <dfn>DNT-field-name</dfn>  = "DNT"
            <dfn>DNT-field-value</dfn> = ( "0" / "1" ) *( LWSP DNT-qualifier "&")
            <dfn>DNT-qualifier</dfn> = DNT-identifier / DNT-permission / DNT-revoked / DNT-extension

        <h2>Tracking Status Resource in the Tk Response Header field</h2>
        <p>
            Organisations often manage very many websites, developed and maintained by disparate agencies and other contracted parties.
            Logistically it can be difficult to manage the declaration of a common Tracking Status Resource by multiple servers run by these disparate parties,
            but relatively easy to supply a JavaScript library reference to be inserted in every HTML head-section, as this is a well understood industry practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it is possible in the current TPE to target any URI as the declared Tracking Status Resource using a chain of HTTP Redirects,
            getting all a company's servers to initiate the correct server-side redirection code can be difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            This proposal calls for the ability to specify the Tracking Status Resource within the value of the <code>Tk</code> response header,
            and be able to declare any <code>Tk</code> response header in an HRTML <code>head</code> section using a <code>meta</code> tag with
            the standard <code>http-equiv</code> attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a <code>Tk</code> response header exists the <code>meta</code> tag is ignored. If a Tracking Status Resource exists at <code>{origin server domain}/.well-know/dnt</code>
            then any TSR component of any <code>Tk</code> response , in a header or in the HTML, is ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new Tk response header is defined formally by the following ABNF
            <pre class="abnf">
            <dfn>Tk-field-name</dfn>  = "TK"
            <dfn>Tk-field-value</dfn> = TSV [ ";" status-id] [ ";" "TSR" URI-reference]
            <dfn>status-id</dfn> =  1*id-char
            <dfn>id-char</dfn> =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / "+" / "=" / "/"
            URI-reference is defined as per [[RFC3986]]
         </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>Tk response header via meta tag </h3>
        <p>
            The server MAY supply a Tk response via an HTML <code><a data-link-type="element" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-meta-element">meta</a></code> elements
            with <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</a></code> attributes that are an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#ascii-case-insensitive">
                ASCII case-insensitive
                match
            </a> for the string "<code>Tk</code>". For
            example:
        </p>

        <h2>DNT header extensions via a cookie</h2>
        <p>
            If a user agent does not support the ability to encode DNT extensions such as the <dfn>DNT-identifier</dfn> or the <dfn>DNT-permission</dfn>
            i.e. <code>navigator.confirmTrackingException</code> is <code>undefined</code>, then the extensions can be delivered by a cookie.
            It is envisioned that a JavaScript library emulating the <dfn>DNT-identifier</dfn> functionality could be installed on a page to be activated if the
            required functionality is not implemented by a particular user agent.
        </p>
        <p>
            To retain transparency and verifiability the cookie should have a standard name <code>$DNT</code>, with the value encoding the DNT-extensions as they would
            appear in the DNT header. The cookie should only exist, and be ignored if it does, when the DNT field value is "0". If the user agent does not support the [[tracking-dnt]]]
            exceptions API then the value of the DNT field value in the <code>$DNT</code> cookie overrides the field value in any DNT header.
            In this case the $DNT cookie should be stored with an expiry equivalent to that in the exceptions API, and the server MUST respond with a Tk: C header.

        </p>
        <p>
            Extensions should look like cookie subkeys using the ASP.NET convention.
        </p>

            <h4>controllerDescription</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><dfn>controllerDescription</dfn></code> containing an array of objects representing one or more Data Controllers responsible for an origin.
                Each object contains a string <code><dfn>name</dfn></code> indicating the unique name of the Data Controller entity along with a string <code><dfn>url</dfn></code> containing the URI of a human readable web page describing the entity.
                If the <dfn>controller</dfn> TSR property is present the <code><dfn>url</dfn></code> property need not be. If the <code><dfn>url</dfn></code> property is present it overrides the value of any TSR <dfn>controller</dfn> property.

        </section>
        <section id='rep.otherParties'>
            <h4>otherParties</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><dfn>otherParties</dfn></code> containing an array of objects representing embedded or contracted third-parties.
                Each object contains a string <code><dfn>domain</dfn></code> indicating the URI authority name of an embedded or contracted third-party <dfn>target</dfn> along with a status value of either "T" or "N".
                If a party can receive personal data and has contracted with the origin server the status will be "T".
                If the party is known not to receive personal data from the interaction, or any data collected is solely used to fulfil a service requested by the user,
                the status will be "N".
            </p>
            <p>
                The origin server for each declared domain with a status of "T" must support a Tracking Status Resource
                also containing an <code><dfn>otherParties</dfn></code> property,
                with a reference back to the declaring origin server's authority.
                This enables the user agent to confirm that the contracting parties are mutually aware.

        </section>
        <section id='rep.declaredData'>
            <h4>declaredData</h4>
            <p>
                This is an object representing user agent storage employed by the origin server for tracking or other purposes.
                This gives the origin server the ability to transparently describe in a standardised way the overall retention time for client storage
                and the purpose and retention period for each storage item. User agents MAY present this information
                to the user, and privacy regulators, audit services etc. will be able use website scanning tools to verify it.
                In addition Privacy Enhancing Technology components, such as TrackingBlocker or AdBlocker extensions,
                can make intelligent decisions regarding content blocking or storage removal when enforcing a user's privacy preferences.
                The object contains a long integer <code><dfn>overall_retention</dfn></code> a positive number of seconds indicating the maximum lifetime of all the declared data.
                and an array of objects describing individual storage items controlled by the origin server.
                Each of these contains a <code><dfn>selector</dfn></code> string used to match the name or name-value pair of a particular item ,
                a string <code><dfn>type</dfn></code> representing the class of storage used where "C" is an HTTP cookie, "L" is local HTML5 storage and "I" is indexedDB.
                The <code><dfn>selector</dfn></code> string MAY contains a <code>=</code> character to demarcate between Regex match strings for the name and value of a name-value pair.
                The purposes for each item is encoded in the <code><dfn>purpose</dfn></code> array of strings. If this is present it MUST contain one or more of the following purpose identifiers.

                    All functions will return a Promise to guarantee asynchronous completion when the Promise is resolved. The Promise has a TrackingStatusObject fulfilment value.

                    A TrackingStatusObject contains a DOMString Status indicating the success or failure of the call. It MAY also contain a unique DOMString value GrantID identifying
                    the consent instance. The GrantId will be associated in the user agent with the other information representing a consent instance, and MAY be
                    communicated to an origin server by soe arbitrary manner so that a proof-of-consent system can be implemented.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The will be a new <dfn><code>confirmTrackingException</code></dfn> function to replace <dfn><code>confirmSiteSpecificTrackingException</code></dfn>
                    and <dfn><code>confirmWebWideTrackingException</code></dfn>. This will return a promise resolving to an object indicating more information about the
                    exception, e.g. whether it was WebWide or SiteSpecfic, the version level of the API, whether the user has been prompted for confirmation etc.
