                If a <code><strong>controllerDescription</strong></code> exists it MUST contain a string property <code><strong>name</strong></code> indicating the legal name of the Data Controller entity.

            <h4>webDomains</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><dfn>webDomains</dfn></code> containing an array of objects representing the domains
                of all resources that may be embedded by any resouce with this origin.
                Each object contains a string <code><dfn>domain</dfn></code> indicating the URI authority name of an embedded party <dfn>target</dfn> along with an optional status value "code" of either "P", "N" or "S".
                A code of "P" indicates that the party owning the domain can receive personal data and has contracted with the origin server as a Data Processor.
                If the party owning the domain is known not to receive personal data from the interaction the code is "N".
                "S" indicates that the domain is managed by the site owner (i.e. one of the entities indicated by the "controllerDescription" array).
                Each embedded domain should contain a TSR with a "webDomains" property declaring its own expected embedded resources.
                This information can be used by browsers, browser extensions or script libraries to help protect user privacy by blocking, inhibiting or managing the actions
                of resources that are not so declared by the embedding site.

            <h4>declaredData</h4>
            <p>
                This is an object representing user agent storage employed by the origin server for tracking or other purposes.
                This gives the origin server the ability to transparently describe in a standardised way the overall retention time for client storage
                and the purpose and retention period for each storage item. User agents MAY present this information
                to the user, and privacy regulators, audit services etc. will be able use website scanning tools to verify it.
                In addition Privacy Enhancing Technology components, such as TrackingBlocker or AdBlocker extensions,
                can make intelligent decisions regarding content blocking or storage removal when enforcing a user's privacy preferences.
                The object contains a long integer <code><strong>overall_retention</strong></code> a positive number of seconds indicating the maximum lifetime of all the declared data.
                and an array of objects describing individual storage items controlled by the origin server.
                Each of these contains a <code><strong>selector</strong></code> string used to match the name or name-value pair of a particular item ,
                a string <code><strong>type</strong></code> representing the class of storage used where "C" is an HTTP cookie, "L" is local HTML5 storage, "I" is indexedDB,
                "E" is information stored in the browser cache such as "If-Then-Else/Etag" values, and "O" is any other form of storage.
                The <code><strong>selector</strong></code> string MAY contains a <code>=</code> character to demarcate between Regex match strings for the name and value of a name-value pair.
                The purposes for each item is encoded in the <code><strong>purpose</strong></code> array of objects.
                Each <code><strong>purpose</strong></code> object contains a short purpose identifier <code><strong>code</strong></code> and an option string <code><strong>description</strong></code> further describing the purpose.
                The <code><strong>code</strong></code> property MUST contain one or more of the following purpose identifiers.

                N.B. Maybe the Qualifiers property should have the same coding.
