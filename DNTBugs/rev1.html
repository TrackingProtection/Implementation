            This is a proposal for an iteration to the [[tracking-dnt]] in DNT 1.0, based on server side implementation experience of  the Tracking, Compliance and Scope, and Tracking Protection Expression documents
            on consumer facing websites in Europe, and client side experience building a DNT compatible browser extension.

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is a proposal for changes to the Do Not Track Tracking Preference Expression document to fix problems uncovered implementing it on consumer facing website servers
        and implementing the full JavaScript DNT Exceptions API in a browser extension.
    </p>

    <p>
        This suggested changes are an attempt to address the following issues:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Right to access of tracking data</h3>
                The current value of the publisher id can be used to derive an audience descriptor based on the data an origin server has linked to it. This descriptor
                should be visible to the user by encoding it into a property in the Tracking Status Resource. The advertiser id will be available via the DNT:0 header
                when the [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt#status-resource/">TSR</a>]is requested from the origin server.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tracking Status Header via Meta Tag</h3>
                It is often logistically difficult for servers to support additional response headers, especially if they are dynamic in nature. We propose
                that the Tk: response header should be deployable via script in the top-level browsing context, using the <code>http-equiv</code> attribute of a dynamically created <code>meta</code> tag.
                This will allow sites who otherwise comply with Do Not Track to indicate as such by including the relevant script, without needing to generate the response header.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>DNT header deliverable in well-known named cookie.</h3>
                Origin specific user consent should be implementable by script libraries when the underlying JavaScript API is not implemented by a particular user-agent.
                Delivering the protocol elements, e.g. may not be possible in a DNT request header but would be possible as the value of an HTTP cookie
                with a standardised name. We propose using the cookie name <code>__DNT</code> for this.
                This will allow the transparent communication of a user's consent perhaps overriding their general preference not to be tracked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    New and enhanced API functionality.
                </h3>
                The new <code>confirmTrackingException</code> and enhanced <code>storeSiteSpecificTrackingException</code> MAY return a Promise with a fulfilment value of <code>TrackingStatusObject</code>.
                This helps the API be more in line with the asynchronous nature of client side JavaScript, and creates callback functionality so web applications can respond dynamically in cases
                where the user agent confirms Consent with the user before the Consent Grant is registered, and is conditional on confirmation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>useSameParty to replace cookie type subdomain rules</h3>
                The use of the domain parameter wastes unnecessary cycles on checking for potential grants for subdomains. The API dictionary now includes a <code>useSameDomain</code>
                property which, if set <code>true</code>, will signal the user agent that a particular Consent Grant should also apply to the domains referred to by the <dfn>same-party</dfn>
                TSR array property. The user-agent MAY check that the targeted domains contain TSRs that refer back to the host domain of the calling origin.
            </li>
            <li>
                The current TPE document has the following bugs: <br/>
                https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/drafts/tracking-dnt.html#dnt-header-field "A user agent must not generate a DNT header field if the user's tracking preference is not enabled.". Contradicts EU requirement for DNT:0 to override DNT unset.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>Extensions to the DNT Header field</h2>
        <p>
            The following extensions to the DNT header are proposed to help support an alternative means to communicate User Consent when the a user agent does not support the JavaScript Exceptions API.
            There can be 0 or more extensions each separated by "&" following the DNT header field value.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn">DNT-revoked</dfn>. When included in a DNT:1 header this indicates that a previous DNT:0 consent indication has been revoked by the user agent.
                    Invoking either the <code>storeWebWideTrackingException</code> or <code>storeWebWideTrackingException</code> JavaScript functions in the origin server's browsing context
                    will result in the removal of this qualifier. The qualifier will also be removed after the original Tracking Consent would have expired.
                </p>
                <p>This qualifier can be used by an origin server to adjust its behaviour on receipt of DNT:1. For example it could decide not initiate another request for consent when the user has already revoked it.</p>
                <p>This qualifier has no meaning if it is in a DNT:0 header and in that case MUST be ignored.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn">DNT-site-specific</dfn>. When included in a <code>DNT:0</code> header or a <code>__DNT</code> cookie this indicated that the exception is a result
                    of a call to <code>storeSiteSpecificTrackingException</code>. Because there is no underlying support for "double-keyed" cookies site-specific user consent must be handled by standard JavaScript
                    in the origin servers browsing context, and the site-specific qualification must be communicated.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The extensions are defined formally by the following ABNF
            <pre class="abnf">
            <dfn>DNT-field-name</dfn>  = "DNT"
            <dfn>DNT-field-value</dfn> = ( "0" / "1" ) *( LWSP DNT-qualifier "&")
            <dfn>DNT-qualifier</dfn> = DNT-site-specific / DNT-revoked / DNT-extension
            <dfn>DNT-site-specific</dfn>   = "s"
            <dfn>DNT-revoked</dfn>   = "r"
            <dfn>DNT-extension</dfn>   = ALPHA "=" *(%x21 %x23-25 / %x27-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E) ; first character is lower-case alphanumeric qualifier then rest excludes "&", ";", CTL, SP, DQUOTE, comma, backslash

            <h2>Tracking Status Resource in the Tk Response Header field</h2>
            <p>
                Organisations often manage very many websites, developed and maintained by disparate agencies and other contracted parties.
                Logistically it can be difficult to manage the declaration of a common Tracking Status Resource by multiple servers run by these disparate parties,
                but relatively easy to supply a JavaScript library reference to be inserted in every HTML head-section, as this is a well understood industry practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is possible in the current TPE to target any URI as the declared Tracking Status Resource using a chain of HTTP Redirects,
                getting all a company's servers to initiate the correct server-side redirection code can be difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                This proposal calls for the ability to specify the Tracking Status Resource within the value of the <code>Tk</code> response header,
                and be able to declare any <code>Tk</code> response header in an HRTML <code>head</code> section using a <code>meta</code> tag with
                the standard <code>http-equiv</code> attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a <code>Tk</code> response header exists the <code>meta</code> tag is ignored. If a Tracking Status Resource exists at <code>{origin server domain}/.well-know/dnt</code>
                then any TSR component of any <code>Tk</code> response , in a header or in the HTML, is ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new Tk response header is defined formally by the following ABNF
                <pre class="abnf">
                <dfn>Tk-field-name</dfn>  = "TK"
                <dfn>Tk-field-value</dfn> = TSV [ ";" status-id] [ ";" "TSR" URI-reference]
                <dfn>status-id</dfn> =  1*id-char
                <dfn>id-char</dfn> =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / "+" / "=" / "/"
            URI-reference is defined as per [[RFC3986]]
         </pre>
            </p>
            <h3>Tk response header via meta tag </h3>
            <p>
                The server MAY supply a Tk response via an HTML <code><a data-link-type="element" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-meta-element">meta</a></code> elements
                with <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#attr-meta-http-equiv">http-equiv</a></code> attributes that are an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#ascii-case-insensitive">
                    ASCII case-insensitive
                    match
                </a> for the string "<code>Tk</code>". For
                example:
            </p>

        <h2>DNT header extensions via a cookie</h2>
        <p>
            If a user agent does not support the JavaScript API i.e. this can be assumed if <code>navigator.confirmTrackingException</code> is <code>undefined</code>,
            and so cannot indicate a web-wide or site-specific DNT exception with <code>DNT: 0</code> sent to the appropriate origin server,
            then there should be an alternative method to indicate user consent, i.e. that <code>DNT: 1</code> has been overridden, by arranging for the user agent to send a cookie with a "well known" name.
            It is envisioned that a JavaScript library emulating the <dfn>DNT-identifier</dfn> functionality could be installed on a page to be activated if the
            required functionality is not implemented by a particular user agent.
        </p>
        <p>
            For transparency and verifiability the cookie should have a standard name <code>__DNT</code>, MUST have the <code>Secure</code> flag,
            MUST contain the value of the DNT header which would have resulted from a successful call to the JavaScript API along with additional information to distinguish site-specific exceptions.
            If the DNT exception was the result of a call to <code>storeSiteSpecificTrackingExeption</code> then the value MUST include the targeted domain name.
            If an origin-server detects a cookie where the domain name in the <code>s</code> subkey is different than the received origin-server domain name, the cookie MUST be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the server recognises the consent indication it MUST respond with a Tk: C header,
            or an HTML response containing a <code><meta http-equiv="Tk" consent="C" /></code> in the <code>head</code> section.

                    Each object contains a string <code><dfn>domain</dfn></code> indicating the URI authority name of an embedded or contracted third-party <dfn>target</dfn> along with a status value of either "T" or "N".
                    If a party can receive personal data and has contracted with the origin server the status will be "T".
                    If the party is known not to receive personal data from the interaction, or any data collected is solely used to fulfil a service requested by the user,
                    the status will be "N".

                    The origin server for each declared domain with a status of "T" must support a Tracking Status Resource

                    with a reference back to the declaring origin server's authority.
                    This enables the user agent to confirm that the contracting parties are mutually aware.

                <p>
                    This is an object representing user agent storage employed by the origin server for tracking or other purposes.
                    This gives the origin server the ability to transparently describe in a standardised way the overall retention time for client storage
                    and the purpose and retention period for each storage item. User agents MAY present this information
                    to the user, and privacy regulators, audit services etc. will be able use website scanning tools to verify it.
                    In addition Privacy Enhancing Technology components, such as TrackingBlocker or AdBlocker extensions,
                    can make intelligent decisions regarding content blocking or storage removal when enforcing a user's privacy preferences.
                    The object contains a long integer <code><dfn>overall_retention</dfn></code> a positive number of seconds indicating the maximum lifetime of all the declared data.
                    and an array of objects describing individual storage items controlled by the origin server.
                    Each of these contains a <code><dfn>selector</dfn></code> string used to match the name or name-value pair of a particular item ,
                    a string <code><dfn>type</dfn></code> representing the class of storage used where "C" is an HTTP cookie, "L" is local HTML5 storage and "I" is indexedDB.
                    The <code><dfn>selector</dfn></code> string MAY contains a <code>=</code> character to demarcate between Regex match strings for the name and value of a name-value pair.
                    The purposes for each item is encoded in the <code><dfn>purpose</dfn></code> array of strings. If this is present it MUST contain one or more of the following purpose identifiers.

                    N.B. Need to specify Qualifiers.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <code>userSameParty</code> boolean is <code>true</code> then an exception will also be requested for any domains specified
                        in the origin server's [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt#status-resource/">TSR</a>] <dfn><code>same-party</code></dfn> property, as long as the reciprocal <dfn><code>same-party</code></dfn>
                        also references the origin server requesting the exception.

                    <li>
                        All functions will return a Promise to guarantee asynchronous completion when the Promise is resolved. The Promise has a TrackingStatusObject fulfilment value.
